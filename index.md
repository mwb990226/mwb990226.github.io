### Making genome editing outcomes fully visible.

Making genome editing outcomes fully visible.

EditVerity provides error-suppressed sequencing and outcome interpretation
to reveal rare and unintended genome editing events — beyond intended edits —
supporting IND-ready decisions.

Why it matters
Genome editing does not produce a single outcome.
Rare, complex, and unintended edits are often missed by standard sequencing.

These hidden outcomes become safety and regulatory risks at IND stage.

What we do
Rare mutation and outcome enrichment
Error-suppressed sequencing
Genome-wide outcome characterization
Regulatory-aligned interpretation for IND readiness
Who we work with
Genome editing biotech companies
Cell & gene therapy developers
Research labs advancing toward IND
CROs requiring advanced outcome analysis
